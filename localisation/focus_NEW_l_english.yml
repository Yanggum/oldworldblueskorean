 new_precautions_desc:0 "Precautions must be taken in Reno to protect our assets. It is not enough to rely on the peace of our neighbours in such a place as the Wasteland. A great wall must be constructed around New Reno."

 new_radio:0 "뉴 레노 라디오"
 new_radio_desc:0 "Construction radio towers across Reno would be useful both for entertainment, as we can broadcast music, but also as a way of subterfuge and communicating with out mobsters and other armies."

 new_sweatshop:0 "노동 착취 공장"
