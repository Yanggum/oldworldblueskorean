  nf_vault_city.1.t: "The All Clear"
  nf_vault_city.1.d: "There is a great deal of debate as to exactly when we first left Vault 8, but surely as the leader of Vault City you have access to this information. How long did our ancestors wait for the All Clear?"
  nf_vault_city.1.a: "70 years after the fall."
  nf_vault_city.1.b: "100 years after the fall."
  nf_vault_city.1.c: "120 years after the fall."

  nf_vault_city.2.t: "Crime Epidemic"
  nf_vault_city.2.d: "When our ancestors emerged from their underground home and built our glorious city with their G.E.C.K., the surviving vestiges of man were drawn to its brilliance. With them came thieves, bruisers, drug dealers, and all other sorts of riff raff. With crime on the rise, how did we ever survive?"
  nf_vault_city.2.a: "Punish crime with servitude to the citizenry."
  nf_vault_city.2.b: "Enslave criminals for use as labour."
  nf_vault_city.2.c: "Give them mandatory military service."
  nf_vault_city.2.e: "Give them the Death Penalty."

  nf_vault_city.3.t: "Stocked Armouries"
  nf_vault_city.3.d: "The defence of our utopia must never cease, as we are a beacon of culture and technology. When Vault Security took stock of the contents of their armouries, what did they find?"
  nf_vault_city.3.a: "Firearms."
  nf_vault_city.3.b: "Lasers."
  nf_vault_city.3.c: "Robots."

  nf_vault_city.4.t: "The Gecko Uprising"
  nf_vault_city.4.d: "After decades of discrimination and violence, the ghouls of Gecko finally had enough. They armed themselves and aimed to take our Utopia. The villainous Brain pulled the strings from the shadows, causing slight after slight between the two towns. Security Chief Wallace suggested that they declare martial law, while First Citizen Lynette urges cool heads and diplomacy. Just as they come to their decision, Brain's mutant mole rats emerge from their burrows under the courtyard. What happened next?"
  nf_vault_city.4.a: "Diplomacy Prevailed."
  nf_vault_city.4.b: "Martial law was declared."
  nf_vault_city.4.c: "The Ghouls took over."
  nf_vault_city.4.e: "The Beasts destroyed us all."

  nf_vault_city.5.t: "Future of the Servants?"
  nf_vault_city.5.d: "The Servants within Vault City have been abused for many decades now, and some are saying that they've had enough of it! There will always be replacements, but offering them rights now could instill a sense of loyalty that we have lacked up to this time. It's not necessary, and many within the city view the notion of giving into their demands as something far below the Vault City."
  nf_vault_city.5.a: "Servant Rights?"
  nf_vault_city.5.b: "Servant Regulation."

  nf_vault_city.6.t: "Servant Standards?"
  nf_vault_city.6.d: "The Workforce that we have been recruiting for decades has by and large been desperate souls, anyone willing to sign those papers and make that deal. Now however, we find ourselves overwhelmed with applications, and in a unique position to demand only skilled labourers. It would reduce the size of our workforce, but it would make the men and women within vault city much happier."
  nf_vault_city.6.a: "Skilled Servants?"
  nf_vault_city.6.b: "Unskilled servants."

  nf_vault_city.7.t: "Servant Work Hours?"
  nf_vault_city.7.d: "Our Servants are more than overworked, they are being worked to death. Their life expectancy is at an all-time low, the opposite of what they asked for when they applied for servanthood. This abuse was once overlooked, but these days? Anyone can see at a glance that we're abusing the hopes and dreams of wastelanders. A simple change in policy could reduce the concerns of so many of these people, but then again... what's the opinion of a few wastelanders really worth?"
  nf_vault_city.7.a: "Work in shifts."
  nf_vault_city.7.b: "Work till you drop."

  nf_vault_city.8.t: "Wattz Shipments"
  nf_vault_city.8.d: "We've uncovered a store of Wattz 2000 laser carbines in our storage."
  nf_vault_city.8.a: "Use them."

  nf_vault_city.9.t: "The Thunderbird"
  nf_vault_city.9.d: "We have been approached by the leader of the 80s. He offers to end raids on our lands, so long as we give him and his tribe the ability to move freely throughout our lands."
  nf_vault_city.9.a: "Accept the deal."
  nf_vault_city.9.b: "Reject the offer."

  nf_vault_city.10.t: "Thunderbird's Offer"
  nf_vault_city.10.d: "Thunderbird offers to pledge himself and his tribe to us if we are ever at war, but wishes to have full control of the stretch of I-80 that we currently control."
  nf_vault_city.10.a: "Agree to his terms."
  nf_vault_city.10.b: "Reject his terms."

  nf_vault_city.11.t: "Storming the Crescent"
  nf_vault_city.11.d: "One of our security teams managed to penetrate the heavily defended mountain passes of Crescent Valley. Inside was a beautiful microcosm, with clean air, clean water, and rolling fields of crops. After interrogating a local farmer, it comes clear that his people have no idea that their leader is the bloodthirsty Face Masher. Though he is a terror to the outside world, in this little bubble he is a saviour and a beloved leader."
  nf_vault_city.11.a: "We shall decide their fate later."

 #Decisions

  nf_vault_tec.1.t: "Vault 3 Survey"
  nf_vault_tec.1.d: "Vault 3 is partially flooded, and the Fiends' occupation of the vault has not helped its state. Establishing an outpost here would not be impossible, but a much easier prospect would be to repair the water purification systems for export to the rest of our settlements."
  nf_vault_tec.1.a: "Use the water for our existing settlements."
  nf_vault_tec.1.b: "Renovate the Vault and establish a settlement."

  nf_vault_tec.2.t: "Vault 6 Survey"
  nf_vault_tec.2.d: "Clearing out the vault of the ghoul infestation that has plagued it for almost two centuries cost us more than a few members of the security team. However, Vault 6 seems to be perfectly intact, and could be used either as a new settlement or as a production center."
  nf_vault_tec.2.a: "Repurpose for production."
  nf_vault_tec.2.b: "Establish a settlement."

  nf_vault_tec.3.t: "Vault 13 Survey"
  nf_vault_tec.3.d: "Vault 13 is still riddled with the bodies of the deathclaws and vault dwellers that had marked its forced abandonment. There is, however, a half used G.E.C.K. We could use the G.E.C.K. to turn this vault into a proper settlement, or use it to accelerate out research."
  nf_vault_tec.3.a: "Use the G.E.C.K. for research."
  nf_vault_tec.3.b: "Establish a settlement."
  nf_vault_tec.3.c: "Let the Arroyo tribe return to their ancestral home and keep the G.E.C.K."

  nf_vault_tec.4.t: "Vault 15 Survey"
  nf_vault_tec.4.d: "Vault 15 is the origin of Shady Sands and the Great Khans, and has housed raider gangs, vault dwellers, and NCR citizens. The years have not been kind to her, however, and between the NCR's looting and its not so savoury inhabitants prior, its in poor condition. To return Vault 15 to livable standards, we would need to use a good amount of our existing infrastructure to relay foundation and replace the more electronics intensive parts. An alternative, however, would be to make sure the vault is safe to enter, and simply open it as a heritage site for both wastelanders and vault dwellers alike."
  nf_vault_tec.4.a: "Make it a Heritage Site."
  nf_vault_tec.4.b: "Rebuild the Vault and establish a settlement"

  nf_vault_tec.5.t: "Vault 19 Survey"
  nf_vault_tec.5.d: "Vault 19 was the site of an experiment in social separation, separating the vault dwellers into two separate groups. The experiment failed, however, due to a huge sulphur deposit that contaminated their air supply."
  nf_vault_tec.5.a: "Use the sulphur deposits for explosives."
  nf_vault_tec.5.b: "Blow the sulphur and establish a settlement."

  nf_vault_tec.6.t: "Vault 21 Survey"
  nf_vault_tec.6.d: "The residents of Vault 21 gambled ownership of their Vault away to Mr House. He cruelly expelled them from their home and filled a good part of it in with concrete. However, he allowed a few of the citizens to set up a thriving market industry."
  nf_vault_tec.6.a: "Incorporate the local economy."
  nf_vault_tec.6.b: "Return the Vault to working order."

  nf_vault_tec.7.t: "Removing the Infestation"
  nf_vault_tec.7.d: "The lost contact with the survey team is now the least of our problems. A plant based infection was sealed within Vault 22, and has infected them. We could either set up a quarantine area and try to research the effects of the infection, or we could clear the "
  nf_vault_tec.7.a: "Research the Infection."
  nf_vault_tec.7.b: "Send in a Clearance Team."
  nf_vault_tec.7.c: "Break out the Flamers."

  nf_vault_tec.8.t: "Vault 34"
  nf_vault_tec.8.d: "Vault 34 was abandoned by what became the Boomers around 50 years ago, and they have inhabited Nellis Air Force Base ever since. They are severely distrusting of everyone, but with the grace of their leader they have allowed a diplomatic mission to speak to them. Vault 34 itself, however, is suffering from a reactor leak, and is inhabited by ghouls. We could either approach the Boomers and give them control of the surrounding lands, giving us a powerful regional ally we share origins with, or repair the severe reactor leak, kill the ghouls, and secure the vault as an outpost in the area."
  nf_vault_tec.8.a: "Repair the Vault."
  nf_vault_tec.8.b: "Bring the Boomers into the fold."

  nf_vault_tec.9.t: "Vault 70 Survey"
  nf_vault_tec.9.d: "Vault 70 was given three GECKs, and used them to great effect creating the Mormon nation of New Canaan. The Vault is rife with valuable social data, between the social experiment the vault was tasked with to the cultural development afterwards. All of this data, sadly, is on an ageing mainframe located in the ruins of the vault itself. we can either renovate the vault, most likely damaging the mainframe in the process, or we turn the old vault into a cultural research center, hoping to rescue as much data as possible from the failing mechanisms."
  nf_vault_tec.9.a: "Rebuild the Vault."
  nf_vault_tec.9.b: "Research the data left in the vault's mainframe."

  nf_vault_tec.10.t: "Clearance Team Report"
  nf_vault_tec.10.d: "Clearance of Vault 22 has gone disastrously. While the team has managed to clear all of the plant life and mutants from the vault, they themselves have become infected. An apology, then the sounds of several 10mm pistol shots echo through the radio, followed by silence."
  nf_vault_tec.10.a: "Their sacrifice was noble."
