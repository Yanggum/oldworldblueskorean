 vault_flock_diagnose_desc: "Our doctors have spent several weeks studying the condition of the Palefolk, who seem to sport a uniform genetic disposition to albinism. That is to say, they are all albino, and overwhelmingly sensitive to the sun. Some of their number have been taken for less than noble experimentation."

 vault_flock_goggles:0 "우리의 고글 공유"
 vault_flock_goggles_desc: "The Palefolk are, by in large, incapable of going out during the day due to their their extreme light sensitivity.

 vault_flock_filters:0 "무리 정화"
 vault_flock_filters_desc: "We have determined that much of why the Pale folk are the way they are is due to their heavily irradiated sources of water.

 vault_flock_brain:0 "페일 자이언트"
 vault_flock_brain_desc: "My lord! The illustrious brain has demanded warriors for his conquests! It is time to gather some of these pathetic pale manlings and drag them into the vats!"

 vault_cyclops:0 "눈에는 눈"
 vault_cyclops_desc: "The Cyclops tribe are warlike and violent in the extreme, a spartan culture that demands them to go forth to kill beasts and men to prove their place.

 vault_cyclops_eager:0 "열망하는 전사"
 vault_cyclops_eager_desc: "Despite having been bested by us, the Cyclops tribe remains surprisingly jovial? They are willing to fight for us, so long as we are willing to provide them with the means of battle..."

 vault_cyclops_fort:0 "옛 요새 개발"

 vault_cyclops_hounds:0 "북부의 사냥개"
 vault_cyclops_hounds_desc: "The Cyclops tribe has fallen into a state of full subservience, and eagerly seek to do battle on our behalf. Loyal allies, or servants? It's hard to say, but even now. They rally to our side."

 vault_cyclops_help:0 "폴리페무스 진급"
 vault_cyclops_help_desc: "Polyphemus, the former leader of the Cyclops Tribe, is eager to aid is in whatever way we can. He asks that we let him leads his own men and then some.

 vault_cyclops_serve:0 "강제 노역"
 vault_cyclops_serve_desc: "The Cyclops controlled far more land than one would imagine for a relatively small and warlike community. Their spirit is strong, and must be broken. A few generations of forced servitude should do just the trick..."

 vault_cyclops_army:0 "올드 사이클롭스"
 vault_cyclops_army_desc: "My lord! We have read stories, old books, thought records! Of the Cyclops, massive one eyed monsters who did terrible things to mankind! Is it not fitting that the brain should also have such warriors at his disposal? Such monsters?"

 vault_utopia:0 "유토피아 시티"
 vault_utopia_desc: "Vault City is more than a place, it's an idea. A post war Utopia rising from the wastes! We are above all those around us for a reason, and it is for those same reasons that so many flock to this place, desperate to get even a smidgen of the glorious technology we have at our disposal."

 vault_med_reg:0 "영토 의료 규제"
 vault_med_reg_desc: "Many of the people that come to the courtyard come seeking the trickle down effect of our medical capabilities. We can't offer each and every person that asks a replacement limb, our ability make promises and quietly sterilize those too mutated to be of further use means we have excellent population control..."

 vault_draft:0 "영역 선발 도입"
 vault_draft_desc: "The seething hordes in the courtyard are viewed by many as little more than an annoyance, a leech upon our resources. It might be true that more goes into them than they give back, but what they are is a ready pool of manpower, a meat shield against the horrors of the wasteland."

 vault_mil_sec:0 "보안 무장"
 vault_mil_sec_desc: "The Security forces centred around Vault City have long been incapable of acting as a proper military outfit. Due in part to fears that they might overtake the city government, and because before there was never a need to expand rapidly. Now however? We find ourselves in need of organized training."

 vault_citizen:0 "시민 의식 서비스"
 vault_citizen_desc: "Our greatest ability to call the common masses to arms is the promise of citizenship within the immaculate walls of Vault City. For them and their families in the future."

 vault_robo_sec:0 "자동화된 보안"
 vault_robo_sec_desc: "While recruitment is a viable option, many within Vault City would rather focus on the production of robotic guardians, due in no small part to their use meaning we don't have to hire and promise anything to the masses in the courtyard."

 vault_serv_1:0 "종들의 미래"
 vault_serv_1_desc: "Servants have been integral to Vault City for as long as we can remember, desperate souls willing to sell themselves into pseudo-slavery for a chance at seeing the inside of our walls. However, times are changing, and there are rumblings of servants requesting workers' rights and reduced hours... "

 vault_serv_2:0 "근무 환경"
 vault_serv_2_desc: "Many of our true citizens have complained about the steadily decreasing quality of servant work. Regulations and tests could be put in place to ensure that only the most skilled servants can get into the city. This would reduce the volume of our workforce, but many would say that it's worth it to keep true citizens happy."

 vault_serv_3:0 "근무 시간"
 vault_serv_3_desc: "We have been overworking our servants for decades now, notably our physical labourers who do tasks far away from the city proper, working as scavengers and resource gatherers. Working them as hard as we do has allowed us to thrive, but discontent among workers is running high...do we reduce work hours?"

 vault_downtown:0 "시내 개보수"
 vault_downtown_desc: "Downtown is the heart of our economy proper, and houses the vast majority of our skilled labour and services. Renovation for it is near constant, with much of our yearly budget going to expansion and subsidies."

 vault_courtyard:0 "영토 근대화"
 vault_courtyard_desc: "The Courtyard has grown into a sprawling city in its own right, housing thousands of souls. It is also incredibly out of date, for it is a glorified ghetto with a crumbling infrastructure."

 vault_sec_station:0 "보안 스테이션"
 vault_sec_station_desc: "Monitoring local radio waves and housing much of the guard, the Security Station is the closest thing we have to a military headquarters, and as such, must be a proper fortress."

 vault_wall:0 "벽 확장"
 vault_wall_desc: "Vault City is growing like the cities of old, and it has recently been pointed out that the vast majority of our people live far from our protective fortifications. A new layer of walls must be created to protect that which we've invested so much in."

 vault_second_city:0 "영토 통합"
 vault_second_city_desc: "The Courtyard problem has been troubling us for generations, for its citizens have been treated as second class all the while. The choice to integrate them into the city proper, proclaiming them a literal, but slightly superior second class should placate them for a time."

 vault_gem:0 "황무지의 보석"
 vault_gem_desc: "Who can compare to the utopia that is Vault City? None and nothing! There are none with such innovative thoughts, such magnificent people, and such glorious technology as us. We are the Gem of the Wasteland, the last true oasis of the old world in a sea of broken, twisted metal. Let it be known to all!"

 vault_riperult:0 "페이스 매셔"
 vault_riperult_desc:0 "Face Masher, the killer of Crescent Valley, The Scourge of Duckwater, plagues the wastes to our south. Local legends speak of a hidden mountain city with clean water and fertile green land in his domain. We must destroy this dreg of society and take these resources for ourselves."

 vault_rip_puppet:0 "시민 보호"
 vault_rip_puppet_desc:0 "Face Masher shares many values with us. He protects his own, is suspicious of the outside world, and is willing to get his hands dirty to keep his people safe. His people are also severely mistrusting of us. Maybe, inducting Masher as a full citizen can help us work toward bringing them properly under our control."

 vault_rip_pop:0 "리페룰트 민병대"
 vault_rip_pop_desc:0 "Now that the Riperult have started to come around to our control of them, allowing their population to form their own military might be a viable option."

 vault_rip_crescent:0 "비옥한 초승달"
 vault_rip_crescent_desc:0 "The hidden, life sustaining valley that the Riperult protected, now clear of their raider influence, is more than ready to be seeded with our own citizens and claimed in the name of Vault City."

 vault_rip_water:0 "생명의 물"
 vault_rip_water_desc:0 "The relatively untouched prewar crops that grow freely in the Crescent can be adapted for use in the Vault-Tec designed growing bays of our facilities. This will give us a more reliable and nourishing food source for our people."
