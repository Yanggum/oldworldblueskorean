 brk_nf_our_fathers:0 "우리의 조상들"
 brk_nf_our_fathers_desc:0 "British Columbia was filled with all sorts before the Great War, and its survivors were no less complex. Indeed, the pirates of the broken coast have all sorts of ancestries, but none of them are better off for it. They all stare down at the bottom of half empty beer flasks and wish for better days. Eventually, they all throw their caps on the countertop, grab their weapon, and head back into the Endless White."
 brk_nf_our_goals:0 "그레이트 블리자드"
 brk_nf_our_goals_desc:0 "\"Back in Redbeard's day, there was a blizzard so fierce none but he dared sail in its winds. It clouded the sky for years, it stacked the coast with more snow than ever before or since, and it killed thousands. They say the wind howled with the fury of the dead. But Redbeard, that crazy bastard, never once got so much as frostbite.\" - Welt, former pirate captain, and owner of the Cap and Cash bar in Koover."
 brk_nf_our_gods:0 "우리가 싸우는 이유"
 brk_nf_our_gods_desc:0 "Money has always ruled the Broken Coast. Much like how the waves dash against its jagged rocks with fury, so too are many hopes and dreams dashed by pirates simply looking for their next paycheck. Do the people of the Broken Coast enjoy the endless conflict their way of life provides? Maybe, but perhaps if they were offered an alternative, they might consider it. After all: everyone wants to retire eventually."
 brk_nf_grand_moot:0 "무트"
 brk_nf_grand_moot_desc:0 "Graven the Cruel received his title for a reason. Even by the standards of a nation of raider pirates, his methods are particularly sadistic and cruel. His right hand man, Ragnar, is much more moderate, and in line with the former leaders of the Coast. A Moot has been called to summon together the Coast and challenge Graven's authority: it will decide the future of our nation. Bets are already being placed."
 brk_nf_tech_upgrade:0 "교육받은 해적?"
 brk_nf_tech_upgrade_desc:0 "A wise man once said: \"Give me a lever large enough and I will uproot the sun for you.\" Today, this wise man is little more than broken charred bones—but he spoke true when he was flesh and blood. If we want to uproot the wasteland from it's pitiful state, and therefore expand the Coast, we need a very large lever: technology."
 brk_nf_tech_upgrade_1:0 "교육받은 해적"
 brk_nf_tech_upgrade_1_desc:0 "After much study, we finally have the lever to uproot the north, perhaps even the entire wasteland. For much of our history, the Powder Monkeys were mocked for the way they developed and relied on technology, but now we understand the error in our ways. Technology is the future, it will let us achieve whatever we set out minds on!"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol:0 "잔혹한 그레이븐"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_desc:0 "Stories of Graven's adventures as a young man are savage, and chilling. His rise to power became increasingly bloodier, and his ascent to the head of the Coast was punctuated by the slaughter of the innocent. The betrayer's moot has invited rage into his heart, consuming what little remained of his humanity. Nothing will hold him back now. §RGraven's fury will echo across the wasteland forever!§!"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_1:0 "지휘권 굳히기"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_1_desc:0 "Blood. Blood was the only word you could use to describe the week after the Moot. Graven, truly unhinged by what he saw as the gravest betrayal, personally took to the streets and seas to hunt down almost every man and woman who voted against him. His hunt continues, but the damage is already done. Never again will the people of the Coast question Graven's authority over them—for fear of his wrath."
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_2:0 "경쟁자 노예화"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_2_desc:0 "Graven returned to Koover at the helm of a ship adorned with the decapitated heads of his lesser enemies. Ragnar knelt there on the frozen dock, put in shackles weeks before by Graven himself, to witness the return of everyone he loved: §Rcoming back to port as rotting trophies.§! Ragnar is a broken man, a trophy commander for Graven, a fierce reminder that not even the strongest can oppose him."
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_side:0 "그레이븐의 웅장한 궁전"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_side_desc:0 "Formerly known as the Vancouver Town Hall, the towering concrete structure that once held meetings on public spending now hosts bloody contests of strength, drug fuelled sex, and an army of the loyalist men Graven's regime has to offer. To stand within his palace and gaze upon his statue of himself is an honour, or so he says. The walls are filled with eyes, and once a man steps out of line: he never leaves."
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_side_1:0 "그레이븐의 궁정선"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_side_1_desc:0 "Graven, still consumed by rage and paranoia from his betrayal at the Moot, has designed a ship fit for a conqueror such as himself. It has every accommodation possible, making it a floating pleasure palace, but unlike most jet dens it also has enough firepower to level anything it might encounter. Graven demands his magnum opus be constructed, and his men can do little but obey."
 brk_nf_wife_of_conquest:0 "트로피 와이프"
 brk_nf_wife_of_conquest_desc:0 "The \"Collared Queen\" sits atop her throne alone, broken, and devoid of life. Once the shining beauty of her proud island nation, Queen Victoria is little more than a doll for Graven's sadistic perversions now, having captured her himself during the siege of New Victoria. Although she isn't tortured and mutilated like most of his other captives, her suffering is clear to any who look into her dead, empty eyes."
 brk_nf_wife_of_strength:0 "전투 경연"
 brk_nf_wife_of_strength_desc:0 "Graven has two uses for a woman; either as a plaything, or as a tool. Clearly he has decided he desires a tool, declaring a gladiatorial contest for the reward of a place at his side. The sane would never participate, but the sane do not desire absolute power. Already, many a demented raider woman has signed up in the hope of taming the cruellest man in the north."
 brk_nf_elites_pol:0 "위대한 라그나르"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_desc:0 "Graven's right-hand man for most of his life, Ragnar the Mighty surprised almost everyone when he opposed Graven in the Moot. His name was not given to him without reason, Ragnar stands taller and broader than any man along the Coast. Having won by a narrow margin, §Rthis beast of a man must now build a staircase out of his dead followers to climb atop Graven's throne.§!"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_1:0 "결투"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_1_desc:0 "The taste of iron in Graven's mouth, a tear from his forehead to his chin where raw skin screams in agony, and the blurry sight of an axe half his size plunging down into his rib cage. With his shattered ribs littering the duelling grounds like confetti, Graven's rule is no more, and now none can question Ragnar's right to rule. All around him, men cheer, \"Long live §MRagnar the Mighty§!, slayer of §RGraven the Cruel!§!\""
 brk_nf_elites_pol_2:0 "브로큰코스트 전사 의회 구성"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_2_desc:0 "With his victory unquestioned and the remains of Graven's powerbase running for the hills, it's time for Ragnar to solidify his authority. He believes that the Broken Coast needs a new system of government, where only the strong can hold court. Ragnar will construct a Warrior Council, §Mfilled with the mightiest men and women the Coast has to offer§!, that will decide the future of his lands one raid at a time."
 brk_nf_elites_pol_side:0 "포트 로얄 설립"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_side_desc:0 "Port Royal was once a hub of pirate activity if the old history books are to be believed. Ragnar desires more for our nation than a lifestyle of raiding to survive. Rather, he envisions a future in which our fleets travel far and wide not just for plunder, but for conquest, too. Creating a mighty port is the first step in achieving this goal."
 brk_nf_elites_pol_side_1:0 "검은 깃발 함대"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_side_1_desc:0 "With his new port fully operational, Ragnar has laid out a series of plans for the construction of a vast fleet, named the \"Black Flag Fleet.\" He believes a large, modern fleet will make our pirates much more formidable, and plans to bankroll the project through sponsored privateering with the new vessels. With his plan, we essentially receive free crews and monthly repayments on our loaned ships: brilliant!"
 brk_nf_warrior_priests:0 "공격 의회"
 brk_nf_warrior_priests_desc:0 "Only the strong sit at Ragnar's table, and only the strong serve in the Warrior Council. Truly, Ragnar has created a system of \"might makes right\" that allows the strong and cunning to thrive. With all of their strength united under one man, this council begins to eye the Coast's weak neighbours, sharpening their axes and training their personal armies for the coming days."
 brk_nf_home_priests:0 "수비 의회"
 brk_nf_home_priests_desc:0 "It is undeniable that Ragnar the Mighty is the strongest warrior in the Broken Coast, and his legendary one-sided victory against Graven has been burned into the minds of everyone who watched it. The strong rule the weak, but all are weak compared to Ragnar. Realising this, the council members decide to train their men in various forms of defence, knowing that one day it might spare them Graven's fate."
 brk_nf_til_strid:0 "군대 동원"
 brk_nf_til_strid_desc:0 "Throughout the Broken Coast, pirates gather in dingy taverns and upon the decks of their ships, bickering about the letters delivered to each of them. The Broken Coast has called upon all of its pirates to repay their debts to the state. Great conquests lie ahead, and any man who participates will be pardoned of his former crimes, or so they say. Many men would die for such an opportunity."
 brk_nf_frozen_shores:0 "얼어붙은 도당"
 brk_nf_frozen_shores_desc:0 "Far north of Koover, near the frigid border between the Coast and the Dredgers, the Frozen Cabal holds court in a fortress of twisted ice and steel. Their ranks are filled with ghouls who are one with the Endless White, and ancient pirates who've seen too much. Their guidance has saved the Coast many times in the past, and will continue to do so long into the future. Their mere existence makes all of us safer."
 brk_nf_raid_whistler:0 "앨빈 블레이크 습격"
 brk_nf_raid_whistler_desc:0 "Whistler is a nation of refugees, all of whom fled the rise of Kamlo. With their former homes lost to them and their spirits near broken, the people of Whistler are hanging on by a thread. We will burn Alvin Bleak to the ground and dye the snow red with the blood of their warriors. §RWhistler will remember the terror of invaders, and realise too late that running towards us was worse than staying with Kamlo.§!"
 brk_nf_demand_whistler:0 "공포의 귀환"
 brk_nf_demand_whistler_desc:0 "Whistler's forests are filled with frozen corpses, left preserved by the frost, their faces forever twisted in agony and horror as they clasp wounds long since frozen over. What little remained of Whistler's spirit has been stomped out by us, and now their lands are ripe for the taking. Whistler's remaining population will be thankful for arrival, even if they themselves don't realise it yet."
 brk_nf_integrate_enemies:0 "정복을 깨고"
 brk_nf_integrate_enemies_desc:0 "With their leaders and loved ones left dead in the snow, the citizens of Kamlo and Whistler have nothing left but despair. Weak as they are, the truly broken are like putty, they can be moulded into any shape you desire. We will take these scraps left in our wake and convert them into a new tapestry of blood and conquest."
 brk_nf_lessons_of_war:0 "전쟁의 북"
 brk_nf_lessons_of_war_desc:0 "The North is a great expanse of territory, ruled by very few due to its harsh climate and remote location. Those farther south often mistake the north for a weak place, filled with backwards savages: this is their greatest mistake. The drums of war beat out a savage and primal anthem of bloodshed, encouraging our men to push onwards to the south, where the most lucrative of conquests await us."
 brk_nf_woo_whistler:0 "실버 텅 외교"
 brk_nf_woo_whistler_desc:0 "Why waste men on conquest when it can be achieved through shrewd diplomacy instead? Shaking hands with the men of Whistler and smiling widely, our diplomat turns every sentence into a trap, §Rtightening the noose around Whistler's neck like a coiling snake§!. Today it's a tour of our dockyards, tomorrow it's a trip to their capital to meet their leader. Do they even realise the danger they're in?"
 brk_nf_protect_whistler:0 "나의 군대는 당신의 군대"
 brk_nf_protect_whistler_desc:0 "With the agreements signed and safely secured, our diplomat has managed to finish half of his assignment. Whistler now relies on us entirely for their protection, having retired their small military in return fo a guarantee of protection from us. Little do they know this is just the first step in a rather fiendish plan..."
 brk_nf_aid_whistler:0 "당신의 땅은 나의 땅"
 brk_nf_aid_whistler_desc:0 "Without an army the people of Whistler are entirely at our mercy, we effectively run their country for them. Moving our troops into key positions to shut down their government will help reinforce this point. However, our diplomat, ever the pacifist, has told Whistler that we'll pull out in return for some signed paperwork. §RUnfortunately for Whistler, they'll be signing away their independence.§!"
 brk_nf_raid_kamlo:0 "카믈로 습격대"
 brk_nf_raid_kamlo_desc:0 "Kamlo is little more than a coalition of raider gangs flying the same flag. Their \"leader\" is little more than an unusually smart raider. Chem pushers and slavers thrive in Kamlo's borders, so we'll hit them where it hurts. Their previous jet and med-x stockpiles will go up in flames, and their slaves will be slaughtered. Kamlo will begin to collapse under the weight of its own addictions."
 brk_nf_break_kamlo:0 "공포의 밤"
 brk_nf_break_kamlo_desc:0 "Raiders only respect one thing: strength. We know this, as the Broken Coast is as much a raider nation as Kamlo. Kamlo has already begun to retaliate against our raids, so it's time to show them how real raiders act. A campaign of carnage shall spread throughout Kamlo tonight. Drugged up raiding parties will tear the throats out of raiders with their bare teeth, scalping slaves for fun as the screaming fills the air."
 brk_nf_enslave_kamlo:0 "카믈로 부수기"
 brk_nf_enslave_kamlo_desc:0 "Without their precious chems the remaining raiders of Kamlo cannot keep their paranoia at bay any longer, instability fed by the night of our pure brutality still fresh in their minds. As Kamlo begins to collapse under the weight of its own degenerate population we will strike, crushing the suffering and insane hordes of raiders, §Rputting them all to the sword rather than letting them suffer any longer.§!"
 brk_nf_ignite_the_forges:0 "강철 점화"
 brk_nf_ignite_the_forges_desc:0 "It's time we get our factories up and running. We need guns for our warriors and we have the slaves to make them."
 brk_nf_salvage_parties:0 "폐허의 구원자"
 brk_nf_salvage_parties_desc:0 "It's time we send some slaves into the bigger ruins to find anything we can use."
 brk_nf_drive_the_cattle_home:0 "코스트를 위한 노예"
 brk_nf_drive_the_cattle_home_desc:0 "Our warriors are too busy raiding and plundering to work at home. We must bring in more slaves to work the pathetic jobs."
 brk_nf_expand_the_forges:0 "강철 확장"
 brk_nf_expand_the_forges_desc:0 "Now that we have basic forges up, it's time we commit more slaves to the forge. This will increase our output greatly."
 brk_nf_water_purification:0 "정화장치 건설"
 brk_nf_water_purification_desc:0 "For too long our people have suffered from dehydration from the lack of clean water. No longer. With this decree we will start construction of a series of great purifiers"
 brk_nf_slave_habitation:0 "작업 수행"

 brk_nf_scour_the_coast:0 "해안 보물"
 brk_nf_scour_the_coast_desc:0 "Pirates like their buried treasure. Our treasure is steel. We need steel to work the forges. Send slaves to the coast to uncover this valuable treasure."
 brk_nf_boon_of_njord:0 "파도의 주인"
 brk_nf_boon_of_njord_desc:0 "For decades we have ruled the waves around the Broken Coast. Now it is time for us to go even farther"
 brk_nf_slave_selection:0 "정예 노예"
 brk_nf_slave_selection_desc:0 "We need to pick the best slaves that we have to work in our factories. This will increase their production greatly."
 brk_nf_blessed_steel:0 "축복받은 강철"
 brk_nf_blessed_steel_desc:0 "Our steel is surely blessed by some higher power. We can build more forges than any known before us. We will destroy all those who stand against us."
 brk_nf_dig_deep:0 "캐나다 파이프라인"
 brk_nf_dig_deep_desc:0 "Recently we found old pipelines used by Canada before the war. If we can salvage them it'll give us a great boon to our resources."
 brk_nf_slave_shedules:0 "노예 권리"
 brk_nf_slave_shedules_desc:0 "With so many of our slaves dying from mistreatment, the slaves are starting to get restless. Instituting more restrictions in how the warriors treat the slaves will keep our workforce strong."
 brk_nf_smith:0 "페이스 유지"
 brk_nf_smith_desc:0 "If we're to become the scourge of the seas then we must keep our industry at the top of it's game. Having our best minds work on ways to improve our industry should suffice"
 brk_nf_add_spikes:0 "해안의 공포"

 brk_nf_add_plating:0 "판금 전사"

 brk_nf_master_smith:0 "코스트를 위한 방어구"
 brk_nf_master_smith_desc:0 "Having high tech power armour would give us an edge over every one of our rivals. All our best scientists will work on getting us working power armour."
 brk_nf_add_more_spikes:0 "커진 공포"
 brk_nf_add_more_spikes_desc:0 "Adding spikes to our power armour will make our enemies run away like little girls. Our armour will be the envy of the world. No one will stop us."
 brk_nf_add_more_plating:0 "강철판 보급"
 brk_nf_add_more_plating_desc:0 "Adding power armour to our soldiers will make them unstoppable. The thicker the armour the better!"
 brk_nf_dockyards:0 "탄탈루스 항구"

Despite its seat of power being squarely in our waters, their well maintained defences and active navy have prevented us from conquering them. But today marks the end of an era of safety for those weaklings.

 brk_nf_dredgers:0 "북부의 적"
 brk_nf_dredgers_desc:0 "The Dredgers have ruled their corner of the north for a long, long time. Prince George is well fortified and resistant to the blizzards of the Endless White, and its access to the river gives it a constant source of supply even when the water freezes over. Inside their territory lies much metal and other resources that can be used to build our fleet. We have never fought, only scuffled, but their mere existence prevents us from dominating the north. If we must kill them to claim the northern crown: §Rso be it.§!"
 brk_nf_pirate_coast:0 "새 시대의 새벽"
 brk_nf_pirate_coast_desc:0 "For as long as the Broken Coast has existed it has been at war with itself. Pirate captains brave the blizzards and sailing the rough seas for revenge, killing friend and foe for caps.

 brk_nf_bellingham_kill_desc:0 "Koover has long been divided between raiders and settlers—the river that splits the city acts as a natural barrier to keep them apart.

 brk_nf_washbos_kill_desc:0 "Seattle has many mysteries: the most prolific of which are stories of its ghostly occupants. Close inspection from a safe distance reveals that Seattle holds no ghosts, but rather, men in dark power armour with burning eyes.
